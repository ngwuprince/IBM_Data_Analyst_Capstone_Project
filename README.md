# Data Analytics Project README Documentation

## Executive Summary

### Goal
The project aimed to gather insights into developers' current technology usage and preferences, future technology trends, and demographic information.

### Methodology
1. **Data Gathering**: Utilized web scraping, APIs, and the Request library to collect survey data.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Prepared and cleaned the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored data distributions, handled outliers, and examined correlations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations, including dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics.
5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Compiled findings into a PowerPoint presentation and stored code and documentation on Github.

### Results
- Analyzed programming language trends: JavaScript/HTML remains dominant, with Python and SQL showing high growth. Kotlin and Go are emerging as potential future favorites.
- Explored database trends: MySQL leads, while PostgreSQL and MongoDB show promising growth, indicating the increasing importance of NoSQL and Big Data technologies.

### Discussion
- MySQL and JavaScript/HTML are expected to maintain dominance, while PostgreSQL and Python/SQL exhibit promising growth.
- NoSQL and Big Data technologies are becoming increasingly important, suggesting a dynamic landscape in programming and database domains.
